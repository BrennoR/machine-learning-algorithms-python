# Machine Learning Algorithms in Python

This repository is a collection of some popular machine learning algorithms made from scratch using Python.
The current list of algorithms made is shown below:
  - [k-Nearest Neighbors](knn.py)
  - [Linear Regression](linear_regression.py)
  - [Logistic Regression](logistic_regression.py)
  - [Gaussian Naive Bayes](gnb.py)
  - [Perceptron](perceptron.py)
